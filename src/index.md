# Welcome to Foliant!

Foliant is a all-in-one documentation authoring tool. It lets you produce standalone documents in pdf and docx, as well as websites, from single Markdown source.

Foliant is a higher order tool, which means it uses other programs to do its job. For pdf and docx, it usually uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), for websites it in most cases uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

Foliant preprocessors let you include parts of documents in other documents, show and hide content with flags, render diagrams from text, and much more.

## Who Is It for?

You’ll love Foliant if you:

* need to ship documentation as pdf, docx, and websites
* want to use Markdown with consistent extension system instead of custom syntax for every new bit of functionality
* like reStructuredText’s extensibility and AsciiDoc’s flexibility, but actually would rather use Markdown
* want a tool that you can actually write custom extensions for without dealing with something as overengineered as Sphinx
* have documentation spread across many repos and want to reuse parts between documents
